RECIPE 

To a bowl, add 1/2 cup + 2 tsp of cake flour, 2 tbsp of red yeast rice powder, 1 tsp + 1 tbsp cocoa powder and mix well.In a cup, add 3 tbsp of hot heavy cream and 1 tsp of instant coffee powder and mix well. The heavy cream needs to be hot enough to dissolve the coffee powder.You can put 2 pinches of salt if you want as it is optional. 2 tsp of vanilla extract, it is a must to put vanilla extract in the batter so don't forget to prepare.    
 
In a bowl add 3 eggs and 1/3 cup sugar and mix till rhe sugar dissolves in the eggs, warm the mixture till it reaches 42 degrees Celcius. With a hand mixer, froth the mixture till for 6 minutes at high speed,to remove any large bubbles, whisk it again for 2 minutes at low speed and set aside. Prepare an egg white meringue with two egg whites. After 40 seconds, add 1/3 of 70g of sugar and whisk well.Then, add 1/3 sugar every 30 seconds and mix well till the the 70g of sugar is finished.Sift the flour mixture in the egg batter we made earlier. First, add only 1/2 of the flour mixture and mix till the flour mixture is can be seen in the batter, then sift the the rest of the mixture and mix well. 

Pro tip - when mixing the batter with a whisk, put the whisk deep into the batter and mix gently. This is to prevent a lot of air pockets in the batter.

After you are done mixing, take a spatula and scrap out the excess batter which is stuck on the sides of the bowl and mix it in the batter. Add the heavy cream mixture and mix gently. Thyen, add only 1/3 of the egg white meringue and mix. When the meringue is almost mixed, add the rest of the mixture and mix gently. Be careful not to overmix.

Take two 2 round pans(15 x 7 cm), put the parchment paper only at the bottom of the pan.The batter will be two much for pan, therefore 2 round pans are required.

Bake at 160 degree celcius for 30 minutes in the oven preheated to 170 degree celcius.

If you don't put parchment paper to the side, the top edge doesn't shrink because the sheet adheres to the pan while baking.It helps to make a flat top. Seperate the sides with a knife or a small offset spatula.Divide the cake into 2 sheets, each 2 cm thick and dont dont forget to trim the top.

For the frosting, add the cream cheese i a bowl and loosen it gently with a spatula as it would be cold. Add the sugar and mix well with a hand mixer. Firstly, add only a little bit of the the chilled cream cheese and mix.Add the rest and continue mixing till the cheese has mixed. Cream cheese frosting can become thin when the temperature is warm. In that case, you can put it in the freezer or refrigerator and whip it again to use.

For the sugar syrup, mix water sugar, apply once, boil, and cool completely before use.

ASSEMBLY

With a brush, apply the syrup on the top side of the cake sheet.
With a spatula, apply the cream cheese on top of the sheet and spread evenly, keep doing this on all the 4 sheets, if done, put the rest of the frosting on top and spread smoothly on the sides.
